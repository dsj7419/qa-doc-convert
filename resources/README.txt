Training occurs automatically in the background when you save corrected documents
The more documents you process, the more accurate the AI becomes
Different document types and topics will all contribute to improved accuracy
Training status is shown in the application when active

TROUBLESHOOTING

If the application doesn't start, verify your Windows version and ensure you have sufficient permissions
If document loading fails, check that the file is a valid .docx format
If the application seems slow during first use, this is normal as the AI model initializes
